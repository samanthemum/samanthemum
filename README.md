# About me #

Howdy! I'm Sam, or samanthemum. I'm currently a junior studying computer science at Texas A&M University, with a minor
in game design and development. Currently, I'm a little overwhelmed with classwork, but I'm still trying to keep up with personal
projects. Check out Desktop Familiar and watch it for updates- my goal is to work on it little by little in my free time.
